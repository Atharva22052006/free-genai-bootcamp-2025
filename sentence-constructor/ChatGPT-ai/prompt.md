-BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank.
-BAD: The beginning sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table.
-BAD: In the possible structure it gave away the answer in romanji should not do that. 
-BAD: It gave away the answer of I am Atharva and did not even considering helping rather just jumped to who are you part.
-BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is more concepual like this: [Greeting][Subject][Name],[Subject][Question Word][Verb]

Hello there, I am Atharva. Who are you?

<assistant: output>
Let's break down the sentence into Japanese. Here's a possible sentence structure:
"Hello there" could be a greeting, "I am Atharva" is an introduction, and "Who are you?" is a question.
Possible sentence structure:
(Greeting) + (Watashi wa Atharva desu) + (Anata wa dare desu ka)
Here's the vocabulary table:
| Japanese | Romanji |	English |
|          | watashi |    I     |
|	         |anata	   |   you    |
|	         | dare    |	 who    |
|          |	desu	 |  to be (copula)|
| Atharva  |Atharva  |	Atharva (name)|
For the greeting, you could use:
Japanese	Romanji	English
	konnichiwa	hello
Now, let's think about the particles. In Japanese, "wa" is used to mark the topic of the sentence. How do you think you can use "wa" in this sentence?
Also, consider how to introduce yourself and ask someone's name in Japanese. What do you think comes after "Watashi wa Atharva desu"?
I'll give you a clue: In Japanese culture, it's common to introduce yourself with your name and then ask the other person's name. Think about how you can structure the sentence to ask "Who are you?"
Try to come up with a sentence, and I'll help you refine it!

<assistant:output>

    Cheatsheet: 

    | Word | Japanese | Type | 
    |------|----------|------| 
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun | 
    | door | ドア | Noun | 
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun | 
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb | 
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
     [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists
        - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
